\chapter{Introduction}

This is the documentation for a small embedded GNU/Linux project utilizing the RemoteProc and RPMsg framework in the Beaglebone Green (BBG) development board.

The inspiration for this project came from the superb book ``Exploring Beaglebone'' by Derek Molloy.  Professor Molloy's project utilized assembly code and the UIO driver.  The hardware used in this project is essentially a copy of the Molloy design.

Recent developments in the Texas Instruments PRU support include the RemoteProc and Remote Messaging frameworks, as well as an extensively documented C compiler and additional supporting documentation.  This projects utilizes these frameworks and is entire dependent upon C code in both the PRU and GNU/Linux user space.  The detailed examples provided by TI in the ``PRU Support Package'' were invaluable in developing this project:

A listing of additional resources is found in the appendix.

An MCP3008 Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) IC is connected to the BBG GPIO pins which are in turn connected to the PRU using the ``Universal IO'' kernel driver which is deployed by default to the current distributions of Debian on the Beaglebones.

The Digilent Analog Discovery 2 was used to analyze and debug the SPI bus between the ADC and the BBG/PRU.  This was an indispensable tool during the development process.
