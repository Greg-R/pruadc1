\chapter{User Space Program: Fork and Named Pipe}

	The user-space program is responsible for reading the data from PRU0 and then writing that data to ALSA.
	This requires the program to create two separate processes and some facility to allow data to flow from one process to the other.
	
	The system call to fork() combined with a ``named pipe'' implements these features in a user-space C program.
	
	Note that the user-space program does not create the named pipe.  A command in the Makefile creates the named pipe in the same directory as the user-space executable.  The named pipe appears in the file system and can be seen with the usual ls command.
